To access your **nginx-54b9c68f67-hcs24** pod in your local Chrome browser, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Get Pod Details**
Run the following command to check if the pod is running:
```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
```
Ensure that **nginx-54b9c68f67-hcs24** is running and is scheduled on a node.

### **Step 2: Port Forward the Pod**
You need to forward the port of the Nginx pod to your local machine. Use this command:
```sh
kubectl port-forward pod/nginx-54b9c68f67-hcs24 8080:80
```
This forwards the **port 80 (inside the pod)** to **port 8080 (on your local machine)**.

### **Step 3: Open in Chrome**
Now, open your browser (Chrome) and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```
This should display the Nginx welcome page or the application running inside the pod.

---

### **Alternative: Expose as a Service**
If you want a more permanent way to access the pod, expose it as a service:
```sh
kubectl expose pod nginx-54b9c68f67-hcs24 --type=NodePort --port=80
```
Then, run:
```sh
kubectl get svc
```
Find the **NodePort**, and access it using:
```
http://<NodeIP>:<NodePort>
```
Replace `<NodeIP>` with your cluster node's IP and `<NodePort>` with the assigned port.

# helm commands
### helm install
````sh
helm install nginx .
````

```sh
helm install nginx helm-charts/demo-chart -f helm-1.yaml
```

### Explanation:
1. **`helm install`**  
   This is the Helm command to install a new Helm chart.

2. **`nginx`**  
   This is the **release name**. A release is a deployed instance of a Helm chart. You can name it anything you want.

3. **`helm-charts/demo-chart`**
   - This is the **chart reference**.
   - It specifies the location of the Helm chart that you are installing.
   - Here, `helm-charts` is the directory or repository where the chart is stored, and `demo-chart` is the specific chart being installed.

4. **`-f helm-1.yaml`**
   - The `-f` flag allows you to specify a **custom values file**.
   - `helm-1.yaml` contains **overrides** for the default values of the Helm chart.
   - This allows you to customize the deployment (e.g., changing replicas, setting environment variables, or configuring service types).

### What This Command Does:
- It installs the `demo-chart` Helm chart from `helm-charts` with the release name `nginx`.
- It applies custom values from `helm-1.yaml` instead of using the default values.
- The application (e.g., Nginx or any other workload defined in `demo-chart`) gets deployed into the Kubernetes cluster.
